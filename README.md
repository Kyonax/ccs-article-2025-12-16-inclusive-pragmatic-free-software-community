This repository hosts the latest CCS community article, which sets out the vision for an ethical, inclusive, and people-centered coding community. The paper discusses CCS’s mission to empower developers—especially those from Spanish-speaking and Hispanic backgrounds—by providing open access to high-quality educational resources, fostering learning, and promoting ethical software practices.

CCS welcomes contributors from all backgrounds and encourages autonomy, transparency, and responsible development. Our principles are inspired by the Free Software Foundation and Mozilla Foundation, but CCS leads by example rather than imposing rigid ideologies or mandatory licensing. The emphasis is on practical, accessible, and relevant knowledge sharing, creating a collaborative environment where learning and ethical development go hand-in-hand.
