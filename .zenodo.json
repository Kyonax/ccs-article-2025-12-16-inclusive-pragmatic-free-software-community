  "description": "This article presents the Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS) vision and principles for creating a sustainable, inclusive, and pragmatic free software community. It articulates core values of ethical development, respect for user autonomy, diversity, and transparent collaboration—contrasting with narrower or dogmatic interpretations of the Free Software movement. By defining practical guidelines and a community-driven ethos, the work seeks to foster openness, accessibility, and professional rigor in software development and knowledge sharing.",
