Ethical software is essential for a healthy and trustworthy digital society. It places the needs and rights of users first, ensuring freedom to use, study, modify, and share software, while protecting autonomy, privacy, and transparency. Movements such as the *Free Software Foundation (FSF)* and the *Mozilla Foundation* have defined core ethical principles that guide responsible technology development. We agree with many of these values, especially with *Mozilla’s* human-centered approach. However, we believe that true *software freedom* means allowing users and developers to choose how to implement and distribute ethical software, whether through free, open source, or proprietary models. Our community rejects imposing strict ideology or limiting participation based on licensing. Instead, we aim to inspire by example and trust individuals to make their own ethical decisions.

*Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS)* is a collaborative community focused on teaching software development and promoting ethical practices. Our primary goal is to help people learn to code, understand why ethical software matters, and empower everyone, especially Spanish-speaking developers, with practical resources, events, documentation, and open discussions. We are not a movement or politics-driven organization, but a group of creators and learners supporting each other, building useful and ethical software, and sharing knowledge openly. *CCS* welcomes anyone who values learning, collaboration, and the creation of software that benefits society while respecting individual freedom of choice. Our focus is to uplift the Hispanic developer community, providing inclusive access to education and encouraging the adoption of ethical software principles across all skill levels.

* Introduction
Technological progress should serve humanity, not constrain it. Fundamental rights to control, modify, and share software have been shaped by organizations such as the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Mozilla Foundation. These groups champion user autonomy, transparency, privacy, and open access as pillars of a trustworthy digital society.

While the Free Software Foundation (FSF) strongly defends software freedoms through licensing frameworks such as copyleft, designed to ensure that software and its derivatives remain free and accessible, these same mechanisms can sometimes introduce practical friction. For developers and organizations operating within proprietary or mixed-source environments, integrating such software may involve legal or structural constraints that complicate gradual adoption, experimentation, or partial use. Over time, this rigidity can shape perceptions, discouraging participation not through opposition to ethical principles, but through concerns about flexibility and integration, ultimately making freedom-respecting software feel less approachable to those encountering it for the first time.

Mozilla Foundation takes a more human-centered approach, emphasizing transparency, privacy, and broad collaboration without requiring strict adherence to Free Software ideals. Still, both organizations have concentrated their resources and communities predominantly on English-speaking audiences, leaving Spanish-speaking developers with limited access to key knowledge, documentation, and relevant ethical discussions.

*Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS)* was created in response to these gaps, with the goal of making both technical knowledge and ethical software development accessible to anyone, regardless of background or experience. CCS focuses on teaching how software is built and how it can be built responsibly through educational content, open discussions, community-driven Free and Open Source projects, mentorship spaces, sessions, and public events. While the initiative places particular emphasis on supporting Spanish-speaking and Hispanic developers, it remains open and welcoming to all. Rather than enforcing a single licensing or ideological framework, CCS emphasizes learning, collaboration, and leading by example, encouraging contributors to understand the Free and Open Source ecosystem, explore different approaches to ethical development, and decide for themselves how the software they help create should be used, adapted, or combined with other systems. By prioritizing autonomy, transparency, and human-centered design in its own projects, CCS seeks to demonstrate how software can serve people rather than control them, leaving the final choice of adoption and direction in the hands of its community.

* Our Principles
CCS is driven by ethical guidelines rooted in the philosophies of the Free Software Foundation and Mozilla Foundation. These principles inform how we teach, build, and collaborate, guiding us toward responsible and inclusive technological development.

** Core Principles
*** *Software serves people*
Technology, including artificial intelligence, must prioritize human well-being. Software should improve lives, support creativity, and solve problems, never manipulate, dominate, or exploit users.

*** *Freedom to use software*
Every person has the right to run software for any purpose, without discrimination against individuals, groups, or activities.

*** Freedom to study software
Access to source code is essential for learning and trust. Users should be able to understand how software works, supported by clear documentation and transparent explanations.

*** Freedom to modify software
Users and developers must be able to adapt software to their needs, change its behavior, and improve it according to their context and goals.

*** *Freedom to share software*
Sharing knowledge strengthens communities. Redistributing original or modified versions of software enables learning, collaboration, and collective progress.

*** *User autonomy*
Users must retain full control over the software they use. Software should not impose technical or legal restrictions that limit choice, manipulate behavior, or prevent users from stopping its use. CCS explicitly rejects addictive and coercive design practices that undermine personal control.

*** *Transparency and auditability*
Ethical software must be inspectable. Hidden, malicious, or non-auditable functionality contradicts trust and accountability.

*** *Opposition to surveillance*
CCS rejects software whose purpose or effect is to spy on users, exploit personal data, or enable unchecked monitoring.

*** *Privacy by default*
Ethical software minimizes data collection, requires informed consent, and guarantees user control over personal information.

*** *Security and trust*
Secure software is an ethical responsibility. Developers must protect users against abuse, exploitation, and unnecessary risk.

*** *Accessibility and inclusion*
Ethical software must be usable and understandable across economic, technical, and cultural contexts. CCS prioritizes access to knowledge and tools for all skill levels.

*** *Interoperability*
Software should work with other systems and tools. Avoiding technological lock-in enables freedom of choice and long-term sustainability.

*** *Freedom of choice*
Users and contributors must be free to choose their tools, environments, and workflows. CCS discourages closed ecosystems and mandatory standards that limit experimentation or learning.

*** *Open development as a means, not a dogma*
Free Software and Open Source are powerful instruments, not ideological ends. The ultimate goal is a healthy digital ecosystem that benefits people, not ideological purity.

*** *Rejection of manipulative design*
CCS does not support dark patterns or designs that exploit human biases. Ethical development respects dignity, agency, and informed decision-making.

*** *Responsible governance*
CCS operates as an open community. Decisions are transparent, collaborative, and guided by social responsibility.

** Ethics as guidance, not enforcement
CCS encourages the creation of software that follows these principles, but does not impose them as mandatory constraints on future contributors or downstream users. Individuals and organizations remain free to modify, extend, redistribute, or integrate CCS projects using their own approaches. Our role is to lead by example, not to enforce compliance.

This aligns with Mozilla’s philosophy of adopting human-centered ethics via collaboration and inspiration, rather than ideological purity.

* Conclusion
Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS) is a space for learning, building, open discussion, and personal growth, dedicated to creating better developers, better software, and improved outcomes for people. Our mission centers on helping individuals—especially Spanish-speaking and Hispanic developers—learn to code and understand the broader importance of ethical software in everyday life.

We offer high-quality educational resources, thorough documentation, and community events for all experience levels. We believe progress happens where practical, accessible, and relevant knowledge is shared. By bridging the gaps in language and culture that often separate Spanish-speaking developers from global technology movements, CCS translates, contextualizes, and expands vital information from organizations like FSF, Mozilla, Apache, and Linux so that everyone can participate.

The community is open to anyone who values learning, collaboration, and ethical development, encouraging members to choose their own paths. By providing resources and fostering inclusive access, CCS uplifts underserved communities and promotes a digital society grounded in responsibility, respect, and collective growth.
