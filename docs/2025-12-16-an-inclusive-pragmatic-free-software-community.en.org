Ethical software is essential for a healthy and trustworthy digital society. It places the needs and rights of users first, ensuring freedom to use, study, modify, and share software, while protecting autonomy, privacy, and transparency. Movements such as the *Free Software Foundation (FSF)* and the *Mozilla Foundation* have defined core ethical principles that guide responsible technology development. We agree with many of these values, especially with *Mozilla’s* human-centered approach. However, we believe that true *software freedom* means allowing users and developers to choose how to implement and distribute ethical software, whether through free, open source, or proprietary models. Our community rejects imposing strict ideology or limiting participation based on licensing. Instead, we aim to inspire by example and trust individuals to make their own ethical decisions.

*Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS)* is a collaborative community focused on teaching software development and promoting ethical practices. Our primary goal is to help people learn to code, understand why ethical software matters, and empower everyone, especially Spanish-speaking developers, with practical resources, events, documentation, and open discussions. We are not a movement or politics-driven organization, but a group of creators and learners supporting each other, building useful and ethical software, and sharing knowledge openly. *CCS* welcomes anyone who values learning, collaboration, and the creation of software that benefits society while respecting individual freedom of choice. Our focus is to uplift the Hispanic developer community, providing inclusive access to education and encouraging the adoption of ethical software principles across all skill levels.

* Introduction
The fight for ethical technology has long been led by organizations such as the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Mozilla Foundation. The FSF, in particular, stands as a cornerstone in the promotion of software freedom, defending the rights of users to run, study, modify, and share software without interference. Their philosophy centers on the belief that software must never restrict users, aiming for a world where all digital tools are completely free and open.

However, the FSF’s approach to achieving this ideal has generated ongoing debate and practical challenges within the technology community. The FSF’s insistence on strict licensing models—such as copyleft licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL)—requires that any work derived from Free Software must itself remain Free Software. While this is intended to prevent the privatization of community contributions and protect user autonomy, it can have "unintended" consequences. For example, projects or organizations that rely on proprietary or mixed-source tools may find it difficult, if not impossible, to integrate or collaborate with software licensed under strict copyleft. This requirement effectively forces contributors and organizations to fully convert their code or projects to Free Software, discouraging gradual adoption and experimentation. As a result, some developers might avoid using Free Software altogether for fear of legal complexity or inflexibility.

This rigid boundary creates a barrier, limiting integration with other software paradigms and making it harder for newcomers—especially those without previous experience in software freedom—to explore, contribute, or learn at their own pace. Rather than inspiring voluntary adoption, the FSF’s policies can be perceived as imposing ideological purity, sometimes alienating communities that would otherwise embrace ethical development principles but prefer a more flexible or incremental approach. The outcome is a landscape where the adoption and spread of software freedom is slowed down, and the opportunities for collaboration and practical impact are reduced.

The Mozilla Foundation shares many of these principles while focusing on human-centric internet health and user empowerment, especially in areas of transparency, privacy, and security. Through initiatives like Firefox and open standards advocacy, Mozilla prioritizes user agency and aims to build technology that serves people instead of controlling them. Unlike pure Free Software licensing models, Mozilla often demonstrates a broader inclusivity, welcoming collaboration and emphasizing impact over strict ideological purity.

Despite the vital work of these organizations, a significant gap remains. The discourse, resources, and communities surrounding software ethics and freedom are primarily tailored for English-speaking audiences. While millions of people in Spanish-speaking regions use technology daily, many are unaware of the underlying philosophies and rights championed by these movements. Some may know of “open source” or “free software” in name, yet lack access to clear explanations, relevant documentation, or inclusive guidance in their own language and cultural context. This disconnect contributes to a lack of adoption and understanding, leaving many developers and users out of important conversations shaping the digital future.

*Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS)* emerges to address this need. CCS is a community focused first on helping people—especially those from Hispanic backgrounds—learn how to code, understand software development fundamentals, and discover the significance of ethical technology. Our core mission is to make technical knowledge and ethical software principles accessible, practical, and collaborative. We create resources in Spanish, host events, build documentation, and encourage open discussion—all designed to empower individuals of any skill level. Most importantly, CCS is not about enforcing strict adherence to a licensing ideology. Instead, we advocate for software built on ethical foundations: autonomy, transparency, user control, privacy, security, and inclusion.

The purpose of CCS is clear. We want to inspire, teach, and support the development of ethical software. We believe software should benefit humanity. Our principles draw from the FSF and Mozilla, but we focus on enabling personal choice, welcoming diverse backgrounds, and respecting different approaches to responsible development. CCS sets an example by building open, ethical projects and giving members and contributors the freedom to decide how they want to use, adapt, or distribute what is created. By bridging the language and cultural gap in technology education and ethics, we aim to uplift the Hispanic developer community and build a healthier digital society for all.

* Introduction
Technological progress should serve humanity, not constrain it. Fundamental rights to control, modify, and share software have been shaped by organizations such as the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Mozilla Foundation. These groups champion user autonomy, transparency, privacy, and open access as pillars of a trustworthy digital society.

While the FSF defends strong software freedoms, strict licensing models like copyleft may inadvertently discourage incremental learning and collaboration. Developers and organizations who use proprietary or mixed-source tools often encounter practical obstacles integrating such software, especially when gradual adoption or experimentation is needed. Sometimes, this rigidity deters participation and makes ethical software less approachable for newcomers.

Mozilla Foundation takes a more human-centered approach, emphasizing transparency, privacy, and broad collaboration without requiring strict adherence to Free Software ideals. Still, both organizations have concentrated their resources and communities predominantly on English-speaking audiences, leaving Spanish-speaking developers with limited access to key knowledge, documentation, and relevant ethical discussions.

*Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS)* was established to address these gaps. Our mission is to make technical and ethical software education accessible, practical, and inclusive—particularly for Spanish-speaking and Hispanic developers, but open to everyone. We provide clear resources, events, and open discussions so all members can learn and apply ethical principles at any skill level. Importantly, CCS does not enforce a single licensing ideology; instead, we encourage responsible personal choice and inspire ethical adoption through open collaboration, transparent governance, and respect for different paths.

* Our Principles
CCS is driven by ethical guidelines rooted in the philosophies of the Free Software Foundation and Mozilla Foundation. These principles inform how we teach, build, and collaborate, guiding us toward responsible and inclusive technological development.

** Core Principles
  1. *Software empowers people*: Technology must prioritize human well-being, support creativity, and help solve real problems. It should never manipulate, exploit, or exert undue control over users.
  2. *Freedom of use*: Everyone has the right to use software for any purpose, without discrimination.
  3. *Freedom to study*: Access to source code and documentation allows users and developers to understand, learn, and trust software.
  4. *Freedom to modify*: Users and developers must be able to change and adapt software according to their needs.
  5. *Freedom to share*: Sharing software and knowledge builds stronger communities and promotes collective progress.
  6. *User autonomy*: Software should not impose technical or legal restrictions that limit choice or personal control. CCS rejects coercive design and addictive mechanisms.
  7. *Transparency*: Ethical software must be auditable, with open documentation and no hidden or malicious functionality.
  8. *Privacy*: Protecting user data is essential; software must minimize data collection, require informed consent, and guarantee personal control.
  9. *Security*: Developers carry the responsibility to safeguard users against abuse, exploitation, and unnecessary risk.
  10. *Accessibility and inclusion*: CCS ensures everyone, regardless of background or ability, can use and benefit from our projects and educational materials.
  11. *Interoperability*: Avoiding technological lock-in enables users to choose freely and supports long-term sustainability.
  12. *Freedom of choice*: Our community avoids forcing specific tools or workflows and encourages experimentation, learning, and adaptation.
  13. *Open development as a means*: Free Software and Open Source are powerful approaches, but the real goal is a healthy, user-centered digital ecosystem.
  14. *Responsible governance*: CCS follows transparent, collaborative processes and makes decisions with social responsibility in mind.

** Ethics as guidance, not enforcement
CCS builds and promotes ethical software, but does not establish mandatory constraints on contributors or downstream users. Participation and redistribution are open; all individuals and organizations may choose how they use, extend, or adapt CCS projects. Our approach is to inspire ethical practices through example, trust, and education—not through enforcement.

This aligns with Mozilla’s philosophy of adopting human-centered ethics via collaboration and inspiration, rather than ideological purity.

* Conclusion
Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS) is a space for learning, building, open discussion, and personal growth, dedicated to creating better developers, better software, and improved outcomes for people. Our mission centers on helping individuals—especially Spanish-speaking and Hispanic developers—learn to code and understand the broader importance of ethical software in everyday life.

We offer high-quality educational resources, thorough documentation, and community events for all experience levels. We believe progress happens where practical, accessible, and relevant knowledge is shared. By bridging the gaps in language and culture that often separate Spanish-speaking developers from global technology movements, CCS translates, contextualizes, and expands vital information from organizations like FSF, Mozilla, Apache, and Linux so that everyone can participate.

The community is open to anyone who values learning, collaboration, and ethical development, encouraging members to choose their own paths. By providing resources and fostering inclusive access, CCS uplifts underserved communities and promotes a digital society grounded in responsibility, respect, and collective growth.

* Our Principles
The principles of *Cyber Code Syndicate (CCS)* define *how* we teach, build, and collaborate. They are not ideological requirements, but ethical guidelines inspired by the work of the *Free Software Foundation* and the *Mozilla Foundation*. Their role is to guide our educational mission and to demonstrate, through practice, what ethical software development looks like.

At its core, *CCS* is an educational community. Our primary purpose is to help people learn how to code, understand software development, and grow as developers. Ethical software principles provide the foundation for that learning, ensuring that technical knowledge is paired with responsibility, autonomy, and respect for users.

** 1. *Technology exists to serve people, not to control them.*
From this foundation, CCS promotes the following principles.

*** 1.1 *Software serves people*
Technology, including artificial intelligence, must prioritize human well-being. Software should improve lives, support creativity, and solve problems, never manipulate, dominate, or exploit users.

*** 1.2 *Freedom to use software*
Every person has the right to run software for any purpose, without discrimination against individuals, groups, or activities.

*** 1.3 Freedom to study software
Access to source code is essential for learning and trust. Users should be able to understand how software works, supported by clear documentation and transparent explanations.

*** 1.4 Freedom to modify software
Users and developers must be able to adapt software to their needs, change its behavior, and improve it according to their context and goals.

*** 1.5 *Freedom to share software*
Sharing knowledge strengthens communities. Redistributing original or modified versions of software enables learning, collaboration, and collective progress.

*** 1.6 *User autonomy*
Users must retain full control over the software they use. Software should not impose technical or legal restrictions that limit choice, manipulate behavior, or prevent users from stopping its use. CCS explicitly rejects addictive and coercive design practices that undermine personal control.

*** 1.7 *Transparency and auditability*
Ethical software must be inspectable. Hidden, malicious, or non-auditable functionality contradicts trust and accountability.

*** 1.8 *Opposition to surveillance*
CCS rejects software whose purpose or effect is to spy on users, exploit personal data, or enable unchecked monitoring.

*** 1.9 *Privacy by default*
Ethical software minimizes data collection, requires informed consent, and guarantees user control over personal information.

*** 1.10 *Security and trust*
Secure software is an ethical responsibility. Developers must protect users against abuse, exploitation, and unnecessary risk.

*** 1.11 *Accessibility and inclusion*
Ethical software must be usable and understandable across economic, technical, and cultural contexts. CCS prioritizes access to knowledge and tools for all skill levels.

*** 1.12 *Interoperability*

*** 1.13 *Freedom of choice*
Users and contributors must be free to choose their tools, environments, and workflows. CCS discourages closed ecosystems and mandatory standards that limit experimentation or learning.

*** 1.14 *Open development as a means, not a dogma*
Free Software and Open Source are powerful instruments, not ideological ends. The ultimate goal is a healthy digital ecosystem that benefits people, not ideological purity.

*** 1.15 *Rejection of manipulative design*
CCS does not support dark patterns or designs that exploit human biases. Ethical development respects dignity, agency, and informed decision-making.

*** 1.16 *Responsible governance*
CCS operates as an open community. Decisions are transparent, collaborative, and guided by social responsibility.

** 2. *Ethics as guidance, not enforcement*
CCS encourages the creation of software that follows these principles, but does not impose them as mandatory constraints on future contributors or downstream users. Individuals and organizations remain free to modify, extend, redistribute, or integrate CCS projects using their own approaches. Our role is to lead by example, not to enforce compliance.

This approach aligns closely with Mozilla’s human-centered philosophy: inspire ethical adoption through practice, education, and trust, rather than restriction.
